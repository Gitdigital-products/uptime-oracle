# Hive Overview

This repository follows the Gitdigital Hive Architecture.

A hive consists of:
- One teacher agent
- Multiple student agents
- A shared memory system
- A set of enforceable patterns, schemas, and rules

All agents in this repository read from and write to the shared memory
to maintain consistency, improve over time, and support autonomous evolution.

Refer to `/hive/lifecycle` for operational behavior.
